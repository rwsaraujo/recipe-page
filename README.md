# Recipe Page

The Recipe page is a page where the user can see all the information and instructions necessary for them to be successful in their culinary adventure.

This project was developed as a challenge proposed by the devChallenges website as a way of consolidating knowledge in building responsive pages (beginner level).

Below you can find the link to deploy the project.
